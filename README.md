# AniTyper

A web application for anime fans who want to practice typing.  

I built this project because I loved typing on my custom mechanical keyboards and I also love watching anime so why not combine the best of both worlds!  

[Live Demo](https://anthony-tran2.github.io/AniTyper/)

* CSS  

**Databases Used:**

## Features
* User can play a full functional typing game
* User can restart their typing at any time by pressing tab
